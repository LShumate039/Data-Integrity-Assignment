                Data Integrity is in cloud storage.

            </li>
            <li>
                Data integrity is important because a lot of firms use cloud because it is cheaper that maintaining the
                hardware to store the constantly updating data they have.

                Proof of Retrievability is showing proof you own the data. This explains it: “In this paper we deal
                with
                the problem of implementing a protocol for obtaining a proof of data possession in the cloud sometimes
                referred
                to as Proof of retrievability (POR).This problem tries to obtain and verify a proof that the data that
                is
                stored by a user at a remote data storage in the cloud (called cloud storage archives or simply
                archives)
                is not
                modified by the archive and thereby the integrity of the data is assured. Such kinds of proofs are very
                much helpful in peer-to-peer storage systems, network file systems, longterm archives, web-service
                object
                stores, and database systems. Such verification systems prevent the cloud storage archives from
                misrepresenting or
                modifying the data stored at it without the consent of the data owner by using frequent checks on the
                storage archives. Such checks must allow the data owner to efficiently, frequently, quickly and
                securely
                verify
                that the cloud archive is not cheating the owner. Cheating, in this context, means that the storage
                archive
                might delete some of the data or may modify some of the data. It must be noted that the storage server
                might not
                be malicious; instead, it might be simply unreliable and lose or inadvertently corrupt the hosted data.
                But
                the data integrity schemes that are to be developed need to be equally applicable for malicious as well
                as
                unreliable cloud storage servers. Any such proofs of data possession schemes do not, by itself, protect
                the
                data from corruption by the archive. It just allows detection of tampering or deletion of a remotely
                located file at an unreliable cloud storage server. To ensure file robustness other kind of techniques
                like
                data
                redundancy across multiple systems can be maintained.”

            <li>
                The difference between Data integrity and Data security is data integrity is the trustworthiness where
                data
                security is the protection of the data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Conventional practice is to enter see data integrity as a one time thing, when it needs to be updated
                constantly.

                Information moves online and has become digitalized, resulting in an increasing amount and varied types
                of
                data
                being collected. We are now even talking about big data. This has made data more important, but without
                integrity, data is not of much use.
                Data is not static, stored once and for all in your systems. Many things will happen with your data
                from
                the
                day it is created in your system and throughout is lifecycle. It can be transferred to other systems,
                altered
                and updated multiple times. Human interactions, data transfers, viruses or compromised hardware are all
                events
                that can compromise your data’s integrity. This is where maintaining data integrity can become a tricky
                task.
                In my job providing data integration solutions to organizations, data quality and data integrity are
                always
                something we discuss in details. I believe that data integrity should be top of your mind at every
                stage of
                the
                data lifecycle, and already from the design and implementation phase of your systems. Data integrity
                also
                ensures recoverability and searchability, traceability and connectivity. Protecting the validity and
                accuracy
                of data also increases the stability and performance of your systems.
