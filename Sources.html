        Proof of Retrievability is showing proof you own the data. This explains it: “In this paper we deal with the
        problem of implementing a protocol for obtaining a proof of data possession in the cloud sometimes referred to
        as Proof of retrievability (POR).This problem tries to obtain and verify a proof that the data that is stored
        by a user at a remote data storage in the cloud (called cloud storage archives or simply archives) is not
        modified by the archive and thereby the integrity of the data is assured. Such kinds of proofs are very much
        helpful in peer-to-peer storage systems, network file systems, longterm archives, web-service object stores,
        and database systems. Such verification systems prevent the cloud storage archives from misrepresenting or
        modifying the data stored at it without the consent of the data owner by using frequent checks on the storage
        archives. Such checks must allow the data owner to efficiently, frequently, quickly and securely verify that
        the cloud archive is not cheating the owner. Cheating, in this context, means that the storage archive might
        delete some of the data or may modify some of the data. It must be noted that the storage server might not be
        malicious; instead, it might be simply unreliable and lose or inadvertently corrupt the hosted data. But the
        data integrity schemes that are to be developed need to be equally applicable for malicious as well as
        unreliable cloud storage servers. Any such proofs of data possession schemes do not, by itself, protect the
        data from corruption by the archive. It just allows detection of tampering or deletion of a remotely located
        file at an unreliable cloud storage server. To ensure file robustness other kind of techniques like data
        redundancy across multiple systems can be maintained.”
