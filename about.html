        <h2>In depth look</h2>
        <p>Most importantly Data Integrity is its security features and specializations with keeping ones data
            including business, personal, etc. to give the user a safe and easy work environment without the worry of
            being accessed without the permission of the handler or main master of that data/information. This also
            allows for the main data handler or the person that is running that specific assignment the ability to
            share it with others and not have to worry about anything going wrong. These problems may include malware,
            or personal data theft by any unknown/unwanted person, etc. Many articles state that data integrity and
            data security are not the same subject or process however they work within the same field together Data
            Integrity and Data Security go hand in hand with each other but also having different values and meanings.
            Data Integrity is uncorrupted data which is considered to stay unchanged related to it complete state. It
            is also what maintains and keeps data consistent throughout its lifetime which brings in a matter of
            protecting it and keeping it secure for it to be reliable to meet industry standards. These standards
            include attributability, legibility, accuracy, etc. Attributability is what data should clearly demonstrate
            who observed and recorded it and when it was observed and recorded. Legibility is what makes data easily
            understood, recorded, and originally preserved. Accuracy is data being free of error and mistakes and
            should be trustable data. Data Security is what focuses mainly on how to minimize the risk of leaking any
            valuable information or intellectual property such as emails, health or insurance documents, identity data,
            threat detections, etc. There is much importance in data integrity and what it does for a user due to its
            elements of security that insure the user’s data is secured between the user and whoever the user is
            collaborating with; however, there are many threats to data integrity. These threats may include human
            errors, unintended transfer errors, malware, inside threats, cyber attacks, etc. All of this includes
            reliability and being trustworthy which is one of the most important factors that data integrity has and
            should always include. In an article it states, “computing moves the application software and databases to
            the large data centers, where the management of the data and services may not be fully trustworthy” (Wang,
            Ren, Lou 2009) . Data undergoes any number of operations in support of decision-making, such as capture,
            storage, retrieval, update and transfer showing that data integrity is within all forms of data storage,
            transferring, etc. Then, data security works hand-in-hand with data integrity to give the user or users a
            solid form of secure and easy transfers and storage of data with zero worries and stress of losing any
            content. As mentioned earlier the information of the user is safely transported to whoever had been sent
            that data which means data security and data integrity work together to keep that data from compromisation
            to the public or an unwanted user or middle man. The main idea is that data integrity is of great
            importance in the process of data storage and transferring which brings a greater form of security to any
            and all users of any interaction over the internet. The fundamentals to data integrity include its
            protocol, basically how it acts or reacts to specific situations and how to utilize any helping components
            to bring stronger security and make it a completely secure data transfer, storing, or installation. Just
            like any other install, transfer, or storing process the person on the receiving end get a secure message
            which includes the transferred data from the sender that had been secured on the way to its destination
            (the receiver). Even when the receiver responds that is a safe transfer between the two because of the
            secured transfer of data (from earlier interaction or interactions). Since data integrity is used for
            security of data being sent from one person to another or others at the same time it also checks if
            anything had been changed or altered at any point in time to make sure the data the sender sent to the
            receiver or receivers is valid which is what bring validity into how data integrity works and what it’s
            methods include. Data Integrity takes part in more than just messaging and data transferring services such
            as cloud management within a group project such as a business project involving code, information, etc. In
            an article it states, “One of the important concerns that need to be addressed is to assure the customer of
            the integrity i.e. correctness of his data in the cloud” which brings a sense of a more controlled
            environment for the user/handler of the data. The same article also states, “As the data is physically not
            accessible to the user the cloud should provide a way for the user to check if the integrity of his data is
            maintained or is compromised” (Kumar, Saxena 1 2011) which means it gives the owner or user of the data
            some form of control over the information and who it goes to and when. This is what makes data integrity
            (including data security) so important for data transferring, especially since the modern world depends so
            much on internet and its many advantages to having an easier and just more realistic lifestyle. In an
            article it states, “achieves the integration of storage correctness insurance and data error localization,
            i.e., the identification of misbehaving server or [servers]” (Wang, Ren, Lou 2009) by having a tight grip
            over a person’s or business’s information or data gives them an exquisite transfer system to ensure their
            data is safe/secure.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, as stated in the text data integrity is one of the most important parts of the process of
            data transferring, cloud management, data and cloud storage, etc. Which all is a key component in having a
            secure and safe way for business and even personal data to be transferred an handled. Main point is, Data
            Integrity is of great essence when it comes to any form of transfers over servers for the internet to
            complete any messaging action over any distances which is one of the most key advantages of this all, the
            ability for one to be any distance away from another person but still be able to work with each other in
            quick succession. </p>
